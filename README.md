# courseRating

For this project i've tried to use scrolling activities, just to try something new and also because some of the activities are pretty long
For this reasoning a scrolling activity would fit well since you could just scroll up and down on the page instead of cramping everything
together.

I have in this project used seekbars when rating a course to kind of give a feel of a slider that goes from 1-100.
For this i have used the OnSeekBarChangeListener to change the value every time its touched, i then store the value of the seekbar
In a textview to both use it later and give the user a visual representation of the change in rating.

In this project i have also used "Sharedpreferences" to kind of save the rating every time the user rates a course.
This is done to make the app more intuitive by not making it reset the rating every time the app is closed.
